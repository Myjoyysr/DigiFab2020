# Introductory Report

At the beginning we had plenty of ideas, like some sort of mechanical drummer, a drone, a sweeping robot, a laser guard, and MITÄ MUITA OLI?. First we narrowed our options down to three: a drone, a sweeping robot and a laser guard. These we joggled with the teachers, and decided to do sketches to sweeping robot and laser guard.

After these first sketches we voted, and decided to go with the sweeping robot because it would be more original, interesting and fun to do. At this point we also gave the project it’s name: Sweeper Keeper. The basic idea is to build a sweeping machine which cleans the table. So it will need at least a motor, some sensors to know the edges and wheels that turn, so it’ll be able to wipe the whole area. We have had many different presentantions of our Sweeper Keeper, and are still in the process of deciding the exact model we’ll try and build. So, that being said, we continued with sketching and figuring out the ways we can make it work.
