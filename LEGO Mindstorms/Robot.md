# LEGO Mindstorms brainstorm consept robot

One of the team members happened to have access to an old LEGO robotics set. The LEGO set proved to be practical asset when designing the physical characteristics of our final project. Initial proof of concept of the plan was done with the set.

## Some notes from testing the Mindstorms table sweeper

* Good option for moving is to use tricycle arrangement of wheels, where front two are equipped with own motors for moving and steering, and the rear wheel is free rotating.

* More than one ultrasonic sensor will be needed to ensure that robot doesn't fall off. Or then some really clever coding...

* Cleaning cloth hanging behind the robot is no a good idea if the robot has to reverse

* Trash-plow should be non-arrow shaped to push objects off the table better
