-The online system where you store the files with
-The introductory report-
The diary report up-to-date

- At the beginning we had plenty of ideas, from which we first selected two: 
  a guard for the laser in Fab Lab, and some sort of sweeping machine.

- We did sketches for both of the ideas, and after that decided to go with the sweeping machine.
  The basic idea for the sweeping machine is to clean the table. We named our project Sweeper Keeper.

- Then we continued sketching and decided the version that we'll try and build. Based on this, we also made first 3d design with Fusion 360.
  The 3d sketch is also doable on laser cutter.

- We also did a Lego Mindstorm -proto. This gave us some ideas on how to make our project work.

- We have also made first code skethes in Tinkercad. They can be seen in our repository.




- The next step for us is to decide the servos and to choose if we want to add two rear-ping sensors for edge finding.

- We also need to decide the power sources for electronics and servos.

- And last, we also need to decide if we want to still add rotary sponge with dc motor and include everything we decide to 3D model.
