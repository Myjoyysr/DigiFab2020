# Introductory Report

At the beginning we had plenty of ideas, like some sort of mechanical drummer, a drone, a sweeping robot, a laser guard, a drinking bottle, a spice box, a moving computer mouse, a car with voice commands, a fire alarm and an automated curtain opener. First we narrowed our options down to three: a drone, a sweeping robot and a laser guard. These we joggled with the teachers, and decided to do sketches to sweeping robot and laser guard. 

KUVIA EKOISTA SKETSEISTÄ

After these first sketches we voted, and decided to go with the sweeping robot because it would be more original, interesting and fun to do. At this point we also gave the project it’s name: Sweeper Keeper. The basic idea is to build a sweeping machine which cleans the table. So it will need at least a motor, some sensors to know the edges and wheels that turn, so it’ll be able to wipe the whole area. We have had many different presentantions of our Sweeper Keeper, and are still in the process of deciding the exact model we’ll try and build. So, that being said, we continued with sketching and figuring out the ways we can make it work.

# Week 1
First thing to do was obviously the formation of our group. We formed a group of four, with two it-students, one physichs student and one information sciences student. So our group has nice diversity, which we believe will help us through the course.

After getting to know each other a bit, we took a moment to think of the ideas for the project. First thing was, that we all wanted to do something else than basic running alarm clock. First two ideas that came up were some sort of sweeping machine and a mechanical drummer. Because those were all we came up with, we decide to think individually a few ideas and meet next week for more planning.

 
# Week 2
Weekend was over and we had quite a bucnh of more ideas for the project: a laser guard, a drone and some sort of spice box to mention a few. We narrowed our ideas to three: sweeping machine, laser guard and drone. These we discussed with Ivan, to consult if our ideas are doable and if they meet the expectations for passing the course. After our conversation we decided to draw sketches for the sweeping machine an the laser guard. The drone would have also been quite interesting a project, but we agreed that it would probably be too challenging for us. So sketching for two it is!


# Week 3
We came up with quite diverse sketches for both our ideas: for the laser guard there were for example a lighthouse and an orwellian watchmen. For the sweeping machine four different presentantions, so everyone had nice first sketches for the project. After these sketches we took a vote and by majority (3 against 1) we chose the sweeping machine to be our project. We all thought that it would be more original, interesting and fun to do. 

At this point we also gave the project it’s name: Sweeper Keeper. The basic idea is to build a sweeping machine which cleans the table. So it will need at least a motor, some sensors to know the edges and wheels that turn, so it’ll be able to wipe the whole area. We had quite good sketches already, but decided to sketch more. And of course we also started to think about how we will actually get our project working: what sensors we’ll need, what kind of wheels and so on.



# Week 4
One of the team members happened to have access to an old LEGO robotics set. The LEGO set proved to be practical asset when designing the physical characteristics of our final project. Initial proof of concept of the plan was done with the set.
Some notes from testing the Mindstorms table sweeper:

   - Good option for moving is to use tricycle arrangement of wheels, where front two are equipped with own motors for moving and steering, and the rear wheel is free rotating.

   - More than one ultrasonic sensor will be needed to ensure that robot doesn't fall off. Or then some really clever coding...
   
   -  Cleaning cloth hanging behind the robot is no a good idea if the robot has to reverse
   
   - Trash-plow should be non-arrow shaped to push objects off the table better


# Week 5
We had more sketches - especially Janne and Patrik have came up with excellent sketches with also some ideas to making it work. One of our main problems are how to make the Sweeper Keeper to realise the area it’ll sweep. As in will we first ”walk” it from corner to corner to know it’s boundaries and then start the actual sweeping, or will we just have sensors that detects the edges and turns away from it. 

# Week 6
One of our team members, Joonas, decided that he cannot no longer participate with the course. So it'll be the three of us, V-P, Janne and Patrik who will finish the project. Currently, we are thinking should we use continuous rotating servos or normal ones for wheels. Not sure if we can use a motor driver shield. -> We decided to use continuously rotating servos in the wheels so we don't have to worry about the motor driver shield. We also finished our 3D design for the sweeper, which is also doable with a laser cutter. First Tinkercad sketches with code are also ready. The next step is to decide the servos, choose if we want to add two rear-ping sensors for edge finding, decide power sources for electronics and servos, decide if we want to still add rotary sponge with dc motor and include everything we decide to 3D model.

# Week 7
This week was the mid-term presentation. After the feedback from Ivan, we are considering if would change our senors to infrared. We will also need to check the Metal Sheet Workspace for our 3d design.
